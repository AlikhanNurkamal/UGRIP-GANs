# Generation of brain MRI patch and tumor masks at once

## Dataset

## Metadata
**Folders:**
* **data_processing:** contains modules used for extraction of patches, and applying skull-stripping

* **evaluation:** contains modules related to evaluation methods: Precision and Recall for Distribution (PRD) and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), and modules related to extracting embedded features for evaluation purposes under the MedicalNet folder under evaluation

**Files:**
* **config.py:** configuration parameters used for training different GAN varieties: 
    * GP model
    * SN model
    * SN-MP model
    * c-SN-MP model
    * DPGAN
    * Also contains config parameters to continue training and generate images from saved models; the config parameter changes required to run DPGAN are specified as comments in the file.

* **dataset.py:** contains custom pytorch dataset class GANDataset as the each patch/label needs to be read from independent zipped files.

* **utils.py:** contains helper functions for training - inline documentation of the functions available in the code.

* **merge_all_modalities.py** reads all 4 modalities of a brain MRI scan and merges them into a single image with 4 channels.

* **separate_generator_output.py** saves nifti images of one of the modalities and one of the tumor labels from the output of the Generator.

* **train.py:** training code for all the GANs.

* **generate.py:** generate patches using the saved models; config file can be used to change model and epoch numbers.

* **evaluate.py:** evaluation with FID and PRD.

* **DPGAN_train.py:** training code for DPGAN preliminary results in supplementary material.


**Input:** Generator - Noise vector of size 128. Critic - output of generator (fake patch-label pair) or real patch-label pair.
**Output:** Generator - Generated patch and label pair. Critic - Critic's score used to train the generator and critic.

**Hyperparameters:**
* Noise vector of 128
* Adam optimizer for both discriminator generator for all architectures
* LR: two-time scale update rule [(Heusel et al., 2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.08500.pdf)
     Critic = 0.0004; Generator = 0.0002 for all models
* Beta_1 = 0 and beta_2 = 0.9
* Max number of features for critic and discriminator as ndf and ngf respectively: 
    * 512 for GP, SN, and SN-MP
    * 1024 for c-SN-MP
